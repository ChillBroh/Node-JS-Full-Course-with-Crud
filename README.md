# 1.Node Module System

    Node Applications are Asynchronous by default.It has single thread handel all request. Thread not waiting for the response. by the time it will serve to another client. after the request complete it will get the response and serve. Node is monitoring event queue in the background. when there is a event ready to process node will take it out and process it.Node is highly scalable for I/O intensive apps but  not suit for CPU-intensive apps like video encoding and image manipulation services.Because node is single threaded application and when it serve
    to a client others must have wait.

    When run js code in browser, browser must have js engine. it takes js code into machine code. (edge - chakra,
    firefox - spider monkey, chrome - v8). Because of this varity of engines sometimes js code behave differently.
    So RRayan dhal take chrome v8 engine out and embeded c++ program and created node.Node is not a programming language. also it is not a framework. it is js runtime environment that execute js code outside the browser.
    In Node, we donâ€™t have browser environment objects such as window or the document object. Instead, we have other objects that are not available in browsers, such as objects for working with the file system, network, operating system, etc.
